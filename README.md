Data Mining project : Student Performance Dataset

In our data mining project, we selected the student performance dataset (Cortez & Silva, 2008). This dataset was created by Paulo Cortez and Alice Silva as part of their research on predictive modeling in educational settings. The dataset contains a target variable (G3) representing the final grade, along with G2 and G1, which are previous academic results, as well as other variables classified as academic, social, or demographic data.

The aim of the study is to identify the variables that can best predict student success or failure in two subjects: Mathematics and Portuguese. For our project, we chose to focus solely on the student-maths data.
